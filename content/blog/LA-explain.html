<p>The <a href="https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/LA_explain/">explain-variation Little App</a> is one-stop shopping for relating a response variable to an explanatory variable, allowing a covariate to be included.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic plot is response vs explanatory (with color for the covariate, if any).</li>
<li>Multi-level categorical response variables are truncated to the most common level &amp; “other”. This lets a model be made using regression techniques.</li>
<li>Shows confidence intervals on the model values, letting you compare F to whether the CIs overlap.</li>
<li>Has a measurement ruler so you can measure standard deviations, effect sizes, etc..</li>
</ul>
