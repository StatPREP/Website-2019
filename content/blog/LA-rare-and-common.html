<p>The <a href="https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/LA_rare_and_common/">Rare and common Little App</a> displays a jittered point plot of the response variable, which can be annotated with a variety of statistics often used to quantify “center” and “spread.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard deviation “ruler” helps clarify that the sd is a distance rather than a value of the variable.</li>
<li>Compare the confidence interval on the mean to the summary interval of the response variable. This helps to dispell the misconception that the confidence interval contains most of the data.</li>
<li>Measuring stick to support reading values and differences off the graph.</li>
<li>Explore robustness by selecting new samples from the population.</li>
