<div id="how-teaching-calculus-might-distort-a-view-of-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3>How teaching calculus might distort a view of statistics</h3>
<p>Example of calculus-like problem … of a sort that I very rarely see in statistical work.</p>
<p><em>The scores on the SAT verbal test in recent years follow approximately the N(517, 112) distribution.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the proportion of students scoring under 400?</li>
<li>What is the proportion of students scoring between 400 and 550?</li>
<li>How high must a student score to place in the top 10% of all students taking the SAT? State answer as a whole number.</li>
<li>Using the empirical rule, what is the probability that a randomly [selected] SAT test will have a verbal score between 629 and 853?</li>

<div id="goals-countdown-3-2-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Goals countdown: 3, 2, 1, …</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>GAISE Recommendation 3</strong>: Integrate real data with a context and a purpose.
<ul>
<li>You: 30 / 33 said learning how to incorporate real data into classes is their important or their top priority. 12 / 33 said “top priority” (So we’ll have to talk about what is “real data.”)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>GAISE Recommendation 2</strong>: Focus on conceptual understanding.
<ul>
<li>“<em>Pare down content of an introductory course to focus on core concepts in more depth.</em>”</li>
<li>You: 29 / 32 – The many methods covered in introductory statistics can be reduced to a small set of common principles.
<ul>
<li>What are those principles? <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12rFpIZnr6abpkpfbRD-GFixI3T-vuX8zvYAUd-2WBu4/edit?usp=sharing">Write them down here</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“<em>Perform most computations using technology to allow greater emphasis on understanding concepts and interpreting results.</em>”</p></li>
<li>You: 29 / 32 Computing offers a framework for understanding statistical theory that is as legitimate as the theory based on probability rules and algebra.</li>
<li>You: Only 8 / 33 were confident in using computer programs to analyze data or data sets</li>
<li><p>You: 30 / 33 Proficiency in using computers to handle and manage data should be an important goal of a statistics course.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>GAISE Recommendation 1</strong>: Teach statistical thinking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teach statistics as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision-making
<ul>
<li><em>“[I]nstructors [should] illustrate the complete investigative cycle with every example/exercise presented.”</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Give students experience with multivariable thinking.
<ul>
<li>Characterizing relationships involving multiple (more than 3) variables:
Never: 12/30, Rarely 9/30, Sometimes 9/30</li>
<li>You: Only 9 / 33 were confident in <strong>developing data models</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="our-goals-for-you" class="section level2">
<h2>Our goals for you …</h2>
<p>We hope you will leave this workshop able and interested to use real data to teach the topics you currently cover.</p>
<p>Ultimately, embracing real data in the ways needed in the workplace and as envisioned by GAISE is going to call for broader changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streamlining the topics/methods of your course</li>
<li>Becoming a role model for proper management of data</li>
<li>Confronting statistical issue that are important to contemporary uses of data but which are not part of the historic canon of statistics:
<ul>
<li>prediction</li>
<li>decision-making</li>
<li>causality</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="three-components-of-the-workshop" class="section level2">
<h2>Three components of the workshop</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Things you can directly use in teaching:
<ul>
<li>Exploring data-driven activities via Little Apps</li>
<li>We’ve got about 20 activities on a variety of topics in statistics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Faculty development: Statistics topics the textbook doesn’t cover
<ul>
<li>Bootstrapping</li>
<li>Unifying inference with regression</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Faculty development: Data science
<ul>
<li>Sources of data, graphing data</li>
<li>R ecosystem</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Levels will range from the easy to the aspirational.</p>
