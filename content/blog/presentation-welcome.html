<h3>StatPREP Project</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Provide faculty development opportunities for teaching intro stats.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Statistics is seen by many as the gateway to data.</li>
<li>Data drives many aspects of modern life and employment.</li>
<li>Most UG statistics instructors have little or no background in stats.</li>
<li>Statistics has changed and is changing as stronger associations are made with new fields:
<ul>
<li>data science</li>
<li>machine learning</li>
<li>remote sensing</li>
<li>medical records</li>
<li>genomics</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>It’s <strong>data</strong> that’s behind the increased importance of statistics.</p></li>
<li><p>Question: What’s the relationship between statistics and data?</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Answer …</h3>
</div>
<div id="answer-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Answer …</h3>
</div>
<div id="answer-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Traditionally, statistics methods and concepts are about the <strong>lack of data</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="changing-faster-and-faster" class="section level3">
<h3>Changing faster and faster …</h3>
<p>How has the content and application of our field changed?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Statistics:</p></li>
<li>Bayes and MCMC (since 1990)</li>
<li>Databases (since 1965)</li>
<li>Confounders and causation (since 1960)</li>
<li>Modern modes of graphics (since approx. 1990)</li>
<li><p>Machine learning (since 2010)</p></li>
<li><p>College algebra:</p>
<ul>
<li>?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Calculus</p>
<ul>
<li>?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Trigonometry</p>
<ul>
<li>?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For examples of change, see <a href="http://www.math.smith.edu/~nhorton/doctor.pdf">Nick Horton’s</a> article on changes in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> over the 15 years to 2005.</p>

<div id="how-teaching-calculus-might-distort-a-view-of-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3>How teaching calculus might distort a view of statistics</h3>
<p>Example of calculus-like problem … of a sort that I very rarely see in statistical work.</p>
<p><em>The scores on the SAT verbal test in recent years follow approximately the N(517, 112) distribution.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the proportion of students scoring under 400?</li>
<li>What is the proportion of students scoring between 400 and 550?</li>
<li>How high must a student score to place in the top 10% of all students taking the SAT? State answer as a whole number.</li>
<li>Using the empirical rule, what is the probability that a randomly [selected] SAT test will have a verbal score between 629 and 853?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="computing-and-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3>Computing and statistics</h3>
<ul>
<li>21 / 26 said proficiency in using computers to handle and manage data should be an important goal of a statistics course.</li>
<li>20 / 26 said computing offers a framework for understanding statistical theory that is as legitimate as the theory based on probability rules and algebra.</li>
<li>25 / 26 said that technology tools should be used to illustrate most abstract statistical concepts.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="change-is-hard" class="section level3">
<h3>Change is hard</h3>
<p>Q24: What keeps you from making changes in your introductory statistics course?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>20 / 25 Limited personal time</li>
<li>16 / 25 Student characteristics (e.g., ability, interest, etc.)</li>
<li>13 / 25 Technology constraints (e.g., lack of computer lab, cost of software)</li>
<li>9 / 25 Departmental or institutional constraints (e.g., choice of textbook, class size, mandated curriculum, etc.)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="goals-countdown-3-2-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Goals countdown: 3, 2, 1, …</h3>
<p>24 / 26 said learning new methods for teaching statistics is a top or important priority for them at this workshop.</p>
<p>Not so interested in GAISE: 8 / 26 said learning how to implement GAISE is an important priority for them of this workshop.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GAISE Recommendation 3</strong>: Integrate real data with a context and a purpose.
<ul>
<li>You: 23 / 26 said learning how to incorporate real data into classes is important or their top priority. 10 / 26 said “top priority” (So we’ll have to talk about what is “real data.”)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>GAISE Recommendation 2</strong>: Focus on conceptual understanding.</li>
<li>“<em>Pare down content of an introductory course to focus on core concepts in more depth.</em>”</li>
<li>You: 29 / 32 – The many methods covered in introductory statistics can be reduced to a small set of common principles.</li>
<li><p>What are those principles? <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12rFpIZnr6abpkpfbRD-GFixI3T-vuX8zvYAUd-2WBu4/edit?usp=sharing">Write them down here</a></p></li>
<li><p>“<em>Perform most computations using technology to allow greater emphasis on understanding concepts and interpreting results.</em>”</p></li>
<li>You: 18 / 25 use graphing calculators in teaching stats.</li>
<li>You: 29 / 32 Computing offers a framework for understanding statistical theory that is as legitimate as the theory based on probability rules and algebra.</li>
<li>You: Only 8 / 33 were confident in using computer programs to analyze data or data sets</li>
<li><p>You: 30 / 33 Proficiency in using computers to handle and manage data should be an important goal of a statistics course.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GAISE Recommendation 1</strong>: Teach statistical thinking.</p></li>
<li>Teach statistics as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision-making</li>
<li><p><em>“[I]nstructors [should] illustrate the complete investigative cycle with every example/exercise presented.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Give students experience with multivariable thinking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Characterizing relationships involving multiple (more than 3) variables:
Never: 8/24, Rarely 11/24</li>
<li><p>You: Only 8 / 26 were confident in <strong>developing data models</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="our-goals-for-you" class="section level2">
<h2>Our goals for you …</h2>
<p>We hope you will leave this workshop able and interested to use real data to teach the topics you currently cover.</p>
<p>Ultimately, embracing real data in the ways needed in the workplace and as envisioned by GAISE is going to call for broader changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streamlining the topics/methods of your course</li>
<li>Becoming a role model for proper management of data</li>
<li>Confronting statistical issue that are important to contemporary uses of data but which are not part of the historic canon of statistics:
<ul>
<li>prediction</li>
<li>decision-making</li>
<li>causality</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
