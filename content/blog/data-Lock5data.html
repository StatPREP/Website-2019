## _D_e_t_a_i_l_s:
## 
##      The owner of a bistro called First Crush in Potsdam, NY was
##      interested in studying the tipping patterns of his customers.  He
##      collected restaurant bills over a two week period that he believes
##      provide a good sample of his customers. The data recorded from 157
##      bills include the amount of the bill, size of the tip, percentage
##      tip, number of customers in the group, whether or not a credit
##      card was used, day of the week, and a coded identity of the
##      server.

<p>Some simple questions to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the tip depend on the size of the bill?</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>gf_point(Tip ~ Bill, data = RestaurantTips) %&gt;%
  gf_lm()</code></pre>

<li>Does the tip (as a percent of the bill) depend on whether the bill was paid with a credit card?</li>
</ul>
