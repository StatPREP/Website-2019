<li>Examine variation in the means and intervals by taking new samples from the population.</li>
<li>Use the measuring stick to look at differences in means, lengths of confidence intervals, overlaps between confidence intervals, etc.</li>
<li>Explore robustness of p-value by selecting new samples from the population.</li>
