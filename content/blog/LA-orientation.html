<p><em>Little Apps</em> provide interactive computing with no coding to calculate statistics, fit models, and display statistical concepts.</p>
<p>Every Little App is built around a common framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the core is a data graphic. The vertical axis is the response variable and the horizontal axis is the explanatory variable.</li>
<li>Controls enable you to select a data set and variables.</li>
<li>Set the sample size and easily display a new sample.</li>
<li>Statistics are shown as annotations, always with respect to the data.</li>
<li>A statistics tab, under the graph, gives numerical descriptions of the statistics.</li>
<li>Most have measurement “sticks” that allow you easily to read values and differences from the graphic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Little App is a specialist in a particular style of display or statistical annotation, e.g. proportions, regression, t-tests, etc.</p>
<p>Enjoy! You can learn a lot just playing with data.</p>
