The [explain-variation Little App](`r this_app$url`) is one-stop shopping for relating a response variable to an explanatory variable, allowing a covariate to be included.

- Basic plot is response vs explanatory (with color for the covariate, if any).
- Multi-level categorical response variables are truncated to the most common level & "other". This lets a model be made using regression techniques.
- Shows confidence intervals on the model values, letting you compare F to whether the CIs overlap.
- Has a measurement ruler so you can measure standard deviations, effect sizes, etc..
