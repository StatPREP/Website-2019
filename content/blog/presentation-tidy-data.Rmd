## GAISE 2016

1. Teach statistical thinking.
    * Teach statistics as an **investigative process** of problem-solving and 
    **decision-making**.
    * Give students experience with **multivariable thinking**.
    
2. Focus on conceptual understanding.

3. Integrate **real data** with a **context** and **purpose**.

4. Foster **active learning**.

5. Use **technology** to explore concepts and analyze data.

6. Use **assessments** to improve and evaluate student learning.

## Real data

The [StatPREP definition](http://statprep.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Spring-Newsletter-02.11.19.pdf):

* **captured in the wild**: not collected for teaching statistics
* **appropriate for investigation** of a particular question or set of questions
    * large enough (think: $n \ge 1000$)
    * rich enough (think: 5 or more variables)

For the moment, put aside the important matters of **context** and **purpose**.

Instead, focus on  the **organization** of data in a way that will contribute to 

* good habits in the workplace
* ability to use technology effectively
* multivariable thinking

Discipline in presenting data encourages good work habits.

## Data organization

* Almost all StatPREP participants say they teach little or nothing 
about organizing data.
    - In textbooks, teaching about data focusses on variable types, 
    not organization. 
* Organizing data properly is critically important to ...
    - **thinking** correctly with data
    - using real data with **technology**
    
<!-- - providing modern views of data -->
<!-- - structuring data collection effectively -->
* Encourage/expose students to "data-base thinking"
    - ironically, this is a very mathematical form of thinking, 
    but few mathematicians know about it. 
    * **SQL** is the algebra that **gets you a job!** 
<!-- Or, for people who don't like a "vocational" emphasis:  -->
    * Data base thinking empowers you to **explore and present both simple and complex data!**
 
### Unruly data
 
**unruly**: (adj.) disorderly and disruptive and not amenable to discipline or control

![](/img/data-images/no-columns.png)

![](/img/data-images/missing-data.png)

### Rules tame unruliness 

1. Always in a "**spreadsheet**" (ie, rows and columns) `r fail("no-spreadsheet")` ✔︎✔︎✔︎
2. **Rows**: One row per unit of observation/analysis
    - No summaries in data︎
    - No other info, e.g. codebook, in spreadsheet `r fail("no-annotations")`
    - Any subset of rows is a valid data set.
3. **Columns**: One column per variable `r fail("no-columns")` 
    - Always use column names `r fail("no-column-names")` 
4. Always codebook `r fail("no-codebook")`
    - Rows: how cases were selected
    - Columns: units, specific questions/protocols/methods
5. Segregate data collection and data analysis 
    - Never change the original data as part of the analysis
    
*Note: This sort of tidy/rectangular data is not the only kind of data, but it is an extremely important kind of data and sufficient for introductory courses.*

### Implications: You need to have a way to distribute such data.

- Google spreadsheets, google forms
    - [Best practices](https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/data-best-practices/)

- CSV files

- More efficient forms

## Operations on Tidy Data

One advantage of tidy data is that it is ammenable to 
**standard, reusable data operations**.

### Fundamental

- **summarize** / **reduce**: convert entire data set to 1-row of summary values
    - in spreadsheet: often not tidy, summary formulas can be placed in untidy places
    - in R: `df_stats()`
- **mutate** / **transform**: add new variable
    - in spreadsheet: add a new column
    - in R: `mutate()`
- **group**: handle summarize and mutate in a groupwise way
    - in spreadsheet: [pivot table](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/1272900)
    - in R: grouping variables to right of tilde, e.g. `blood_pressure ~ age + sex` 
- **filter** / **select**: remove/ignore rows or columns
    - in spreadsheet: ["hide" data](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3540681)
    - in R: `filter()` for rows, `select()` for columns

### Superficial

- **arrange**
    - in spreadsheet, "sort". But how do you do this without altering the data?
    - in R: `arrange()`

### Profound

- **join**: bring together data from multiple sources
    - in spreadsheet ["fusion tables"](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/171254?hl=en) but will be [phased out in Dec. 2019 in terms of SQL operations](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/9185417)
- **spread** / **gather**: change unit of analysis
    - in spreadsheet [pivot/unpivot](https://eagereyes.org/basics/spreadsheet-thinking-vs-database-thinking) 
    - in R: `spread()`, `gather()` [soon to be `pivot_wide()`, `pivot_long()`]

## Variable types

These are often introduced as definitions before the student has any use for them. 

In stats book: 

![](/img/data-images/variable-types.jpg)

Key distinction / minor distinctions

- **numerical**: interval, ratio, count, measure,  ...
- **categorical**: unordered, ordered
    

### Variable types in actual use:

1. numerical: 
    a. **quantities** (with **dimension** and **units**) --
    a. **times** and **dates**
    a. **counts** (natural numbers)
    a. ~~codes: codes represent discrete levels, not really numerical~~
    
<!-- it's worthwhile to be able to distinquish these special types -->
<!--     i. arbitrary origin (e.g. °F or °C) vs meaningful origin independent  -->
<!--     of the units, e.g.  counts, growth rates -->
<!--             - in graphics, make sure zero is on the axis! -->

2. categorical: 
    a. fixed vs "random" 
        * Fixed: data contains all levels of interest
        * Random: data represents a subset of/sample from levels of interest

<!-- ### Operations on variables -->

<!-- Some operations only make sense for certain types of variables -->

<!-- - sum / mean -->
<!--     - helps distinguish numerical codes from true numerical variables -->
<!--     - is sum meaningful? e.g. miles per gallon versus gallons per mile -->

<!-- ### Transformation variables -->

<!-- - ratio (only with natural origin): but how often are we doing ratio transformations in stats class? -->
<!-- - difference () -->
<!-- - sqrt, log, ... (only with natural origin) -->
