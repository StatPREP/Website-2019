The [Rare and common Little App](`r this_app$url`) displays a jittered point plot of the response variable, which can be annotated with a variety of statistics often used to quantify "center" and "spread."

- Standard deviation "ruler" helps clarify that the sd is a distance rather than a value of the variable.
- Compare the confidence interval on the mean to the summary interval of the response variable. This helps to dispell the misconception that the confidence interval contains most of the data.
- Measuring stick to support reading values and differences off the graph.
- Explore robustness by selecting new samples from the population.
