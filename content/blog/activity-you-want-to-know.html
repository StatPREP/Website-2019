<p><strong>Instructions.</strong> In each scenario below,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>determine what variables you would need to collect and whether each is categorical or quantitative,</p></li>
<li><p>describe or sketch a graph you would make to give you an initial impression
regarding the answer to the question of interest,</p></li>
<li><p>determine the paramater(s) of interest and explain how they are different
from the variables,</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- * and state the null and alternative hypotheses if you are going to -->
<!-- do a hypothesis test, -->
<ul>
<li>determine whether you are using a paired design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes there may be more than one way to design the study, but don’t
design a poor study when a better option is available.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You want to know what proportion of students at your institution got a flu shot this year.</p></li>
<li><p>You want to know whether male students or female students were more likely to get a flu shot this year.</p></li>
<li><p>You want to know whether people who got a flu shot were more likely or less likely to get the flu.</p></li>
<li><p>You want to know which of two vaccines is better at preventing flu.</p></li>
<li><p>You want to know whether a new drug works better than an old drug at reducing cholesterol.</p></li>
<li><p>You want to know whether rhubarb grows faster or slower if you cover it with a bucket for 3 weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>You want to know whether people can swim faster if they wear wetsuits.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You might find it handy to organize you work into a table like this:</p>
