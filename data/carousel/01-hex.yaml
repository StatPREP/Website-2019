description: >
  <p>Statistics is fundamentally about data; StatPREP is fundamentally 
  about helping instructors teach with data.</p>
  <p>Each June, four 1Â½ day workshops are run in four different major metropolitan areas. 
  The workshops are designed for instructors whose primary training may 
  not be in statistics and who may not have previous experience with statistical computing.</p>
