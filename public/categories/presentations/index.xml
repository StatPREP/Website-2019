      <description>The Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education The GAISE report (2016) was produced by a committee of leading statistical educators and endorsed by the ASA and AMATYC. It gives specific recommendations and some examples about best practices in teaching statistics.
Goals for intro stats  Goal 1. Students should become critical consumers of statistically-based results reported in popular media, recognizing whether reported results reasonably follow from the study and analysis conducted.</description>

      <description>GAISE 2016 Teach statistical thinking.  Teach statistics as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision- making. Give students experience with multivariable thinking.  Focus on conceptual understanding.
 Integrate real data with a context and purpose.
 Foster active learning.
 Use technology to explore concepts and analyze data.
 Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning.
   Real data The StatPREP definition:
 1000-ish rows, 4+-ish variables captured in the wild: not collected for teaching statistics  For the moment, put aside the important matters of context and purpose.</description>

      <description>The Grammar of Graphics The title comes from Leland Wilkinson’s book, The Grammar of Graphics
The first chapter is quite mathematical – give it a look by following the link above.
One purpose was to give a way of describing graphics in the face of a combinatorial explosion of designs.
 How to describe graphics to the computer for drawing.  But it also provides a way for teaching graphics.</description>

Real data At the October 2018 StatPREP meeting at the Mathematical Association of America’s DC headquarters the new MAA deputy executive director, Rachel Levy asked a simple question: What’s real data?
A core recommendation of the American Statistical Association’s GAISE report is to “use real data” when teaching statistics. Prof. Levy wasn’t looking to prompt a philosophical discussion of the nature of reality, but to define a benchmark.</description>
