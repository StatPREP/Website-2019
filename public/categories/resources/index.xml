      <description>Stats for Data Science is a forward-looking introductory-level textbook currently in draft form. The book is available on-line here.
From the preface â€¦ Data science is an emerging computational discipline with roots sprouting in contemporary problems. Almost always these problems involve large amounts of data collected by automated systems and collated by bringing together diverse data from different sources. The goals for working with such data are varied: predicting the preferences of individual people for consumer products or news feeds; examining government or business or clinical medical records to answer questions such as the efficacy of a proposed program or intervention in public health; detecting and classifying rare events such as credit-card fraud; finding useful patterns in clouds of text or data that might help identify harmful interactions between medicines or extract meaning from thousands of documents.</description>
