      <description>Tips for Creating an Active Classroom Make your lectures active, too.
It is tempting to equate “active learning” with “group work”, Think about ways to make lectures more active for students. Interject questions (and wait for answers). Mix in short “your turn” exercises or “think-pair-share” questions. Use “call and response”. Ask students to guess computer commands before introducing new commands.
Ask lots of questions.
 But don’t answer them yourself.</description>

      <description>Many instructors believe that learning is enhanced in a classroom where students are active participants rather than the passive recipients of a lecture. This document describes some general techniques for fostering an active classroom that can be used in a wide range of lesson topics. (There are also tips for specific topics included in the instructor guide for each topic.)
What’s key is to constantly look for opportunities to force students to make a choice, offer a suggestion, or state an interpretation or an opinion.</description>
