      <description>The documents on this site are formatted for instructors. There are also documents formatted for students. * If you want to hand out a printed version of the activity, there is a link to a Word format near the top of each document. Feel free to customize this to suit your own class! * If you prefer to give your students a URL so they can access the document via the web, we suggest you give them the Student link that can be found in each document.</description>
