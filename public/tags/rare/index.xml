      <description>Center-and-spread Little App: The distribution of mother’s age at birth is different for those on private insurance and those on government insurance.   
The Rare and common Little App displays a jittered point plot of the response variable, which can be annotated with a variety of statistics often used to quantify “center” and “spread.”
 Standard deviation “ruler” helps clarify that the sd is a distance rather than a value of the variable.</description>

Orientation English has many words to describe what statistician’s call frequency: common, unusual, rare, infrequent, uncommon, and so on. There’s no precise, numerical meaning to these words; they are used to create an impression.
In statistics, it’s helpful to have standard ways to refer to frequency. The standard deviation provides a widely accepted measure of commonality or rareness. It’s not just statisticians who use this measure.</description>

Orientation We’re continuing the story of two friends interested in how to measure poverty. You met with them at a coffee shop to show them the NHANES data and how to display it in the t-test Little App. You had arranged the display to have income_poverty as the response variable and home_type as the explanatory variable. The sample size was n = 100, since that’s the number of families your friends were thinking of interviewing.</description>
