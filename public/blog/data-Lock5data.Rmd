The textbook *[Statistics: Unlocking the Power of Data](http://www.lock5stat.com/index.html)* (2/e 2017) by Lock, Lock, Lock, Lock, and Lock has publicly available datasets and interactive applets.

A list of the more than 100 datasets in the collection is available at [this site](http://www.lock5stat.com/datapage.html).  There is also an R package, `Lock5Data`, that contains documentation  for  the  data. 

## Example: Restaurant tips

The data frame `RestaurantTips` contains,  ... well let's look directly at the documentation.

```r
library(Lock5Data)
help(RestaurantTips)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='markup'}
db <- tools::Rd_db("Lock5Data")
    doc_contents <- db[[paste0("RestaurantTips", ".Rd")]]
cat(paste(capture.output(tools::Rd2txt(doc_contents)), collapse = "\n"))
```

Some simple questions to ask:

- Does the tip depend on  the size of the bill?

```{r}
gf_point(Tip ~ Bill, data = RestaurantTips) %>%
  gf_lm()
```

- Does the tip (as a percent of the bill) depend on whether the bill  was paid with a credit card? 

```{r}
gf_jitter(Tip ~ Credit, data = RestaurantTips)  %>%
  gf_violin(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.3, color  = NA) 
```
