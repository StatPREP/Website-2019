## Orientation 

There's an expression about how to accomplish a complex, confusing, and difficult task: *One step at a time.* The purpose of this lesson is to provide you with a step-by-step procedure for working  with data. Each step can be straightforward. Some steps involve informing yourself about the data at hand.  Some steps require creativity and insight about the real-world system the data represents. Some steps require application of a particular technical procedure.

Here are steps for getting started with a data frame that's already available to you.

1. Find out what is the *unit of observation*, that is, what each row stands for.
2. Find out what are the *variables*, the name of each, and what each one stands for.
3. Choose a *response variable*.
4. Select one or more *explanatory variables* which you suspect might account for the response variable.
5. Examine *how much* of the variation in the response variable is accounted for by the explanatory variables.
6. Describe in words and numbers the *pattern of the relationship* between the explanatory variables and the response variable. 

In this lesson, you're going to work on steps (1) and (2).


## Activity

You'll use the  [variables-and-units  Little App](`r point_plot_app$url`) for this lesson. (See footnote^[<`r point_plot_app$url`>]). Open the  little app and select the `NHANES` data.


Steps (1)  and (2) are to find  out about the data frame: What is the unit of analysis  and what are the variables. A standard  place to get  information about a data frame is the *codebook* for the data frame, which is the descriptive documentation about the data.

1. Go to the ***Codebook*** tab in the app. The documentation will appear. 
The *unit of observation* is the kind of "thing" each row of the data is about. 

     * Read the description section of the codebook. This often contains clues about  the unit of observation. Note the  words "survey," "individuals," "interviewed." 

    `r question_blank("*What do you think is the unit of observation?*", breaks = 2, length = 2)` <!-- an individual person -->

2. The variables are described further on in the codebook.

    * Some variables have simple names like `Age`. Find a few other variables whose meaning is obvious to you even without looking at the description in the codebook.
    
    `r question_blank("*Write down the names of a few obvious variables.*", breaks = 2, length = 2)`
    
    *  Some variables have names that are more like a codeword, like `BPSysAve`. Find a few variables with such names and see if the description  of the variable's meaning helps you understand what the variable is about.
    
    `r question_blank("*Are there any variables for which even the description in the codebook doesn't help you understand? Write down one and speculate what it might be about.*", breaks = 3, length = 2)`
