The [Proportions Little App](`r this_app$url`) allows you to explore how the probability of a categorical outcome varies with  either categorical or quantitative variables.

- Choose the level of the response variable for which you want to know the proportion.
- Display confidence intervals/bands.
- Explanatory variable can be either categorical or quantitative.
- Logistic or linear models used when explanatory variable is quantitative.
- Explore robustness by selecting new samples from the population.
