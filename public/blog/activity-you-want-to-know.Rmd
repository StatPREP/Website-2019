### Instructions

In each scenario below, 

* determine what variables you would need to collect and whether each is categorical or quantitative, 

* describe or sketch a graph you would make to give you an initial impression
regarding the answer to the question of interest,

* determine the paramater(s) of interest and explain how they are different
from the variables, 

<!-- * and state the null and alternative hypotheses if you are going to -->
<!-- do a hypothesis test, -->

* determine whether you are using a paired design.

Sometimes there may be more than one way to design the study, but don't 
design a poor study when a better option is available.
