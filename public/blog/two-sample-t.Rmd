- Length  of confidence intervals as a function of n.
- Examine variation in the means and intervals by taking new samples from the population.
- Use the measuring stick to look  at differences in means, lengths of confidence intervals,  overlaps between confidence intervals, etc.
- Explore robustness of p-value by selecting new samples from the population.
