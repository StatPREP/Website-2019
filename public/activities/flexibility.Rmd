Systolic versus diastolic in NHANES. A stiff line is too strongly influenced by the people with very low diastolic blood pressure. Adding some flexibility allows the relationship for those with normal pressure to be more evident. I'm guessing very low diastolic pressure is OK, but you can't lower systolic pressure accordingly and stay alive.
